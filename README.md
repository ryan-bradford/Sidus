# Sidus
A app that can be used as a 3D compass which locates certain waypoints. Great for hikers, travelers, explorers, 
and path seekers!

The name Waypointer can be seen throughout the code as a legacy of sorts - the origonal name was Waypointer and I ended
up changing it (and ultimately regretting the change).
